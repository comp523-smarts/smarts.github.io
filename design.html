<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>
    The overall design of our application is depicted in the following diagram:
</p>
<img 
    src="./architecture_diagram.png" 
    alt="architecture diagram" 
    style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 60%; padding: 18px">
<p>
    Beginning with the top left, we have server-side code that is written in JavaScript, driven
    by the Node.js engine, and hosted on Heroku's free-tier cloud platform. This code exposes a set
    of RESTful endpoints that act as an interface between the web/mobile frontends and the MongoDB
    database where all application data is persistently stored. While our MongoDB instance is also
    hosted on Heroku, it lives in a separate dyno (i.e. either a different server, or a virtualized
    machine on the same server) so database queries are networked. In particular, we use the 
    <a href="https://mongoosejs.com">Mongoose</a> ORM library to validate documents against structured
    object models before storing them permanently in the database. Lastly, the Google Maps Geocoding
    API is used to automatically get latitude/longitude data whenever a new Hospital is added to the
    database. 
</p>
<p>
    Next, we have two independent codebases on the client-side:
    <ol>
        <li>An administrator portal, written with the Handlebars templating engine and standard CSS/jQuery</li>
        <li>A mobile app, written in React Native and supported by the Expo SDK</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Web pages in the administrator portal are generated from Handlebars templates and served by the 
    backend upon first request, but all subsequent interactions occur via AJAX requests. The operations 
    supported (create, read, update, destroy) for admins are simple enough that jQuery was sufficient
    to build an interactive dashboard. 
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, all data presented in the mobile app is requested on launch via the native
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> API. This allows 
    additions/updates to information by administrators to instantaneoulsy propagate to end-users, but
    also causes the app to crash if the server crashes. The app also gets permissions from users to 
    access their latitude and longitude so that distances to hospitals can be displayed. This works
    cross-platform, and if a user rejects location permissions all other data is still available.
</p>

<h4>Codebase</h4>
<p>
    The codebase is available <a href="https://github.com/comp523-trauma-ready/trauma-ready">here</a>.
    It is written entirely in JavaScript and its major modules and directory structure are represented
    by this diagram: 
    <pre>
    | trauma-ready
    |
    |&mdash;&mdash; tr-backend
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; public
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; src
    |   |   |&mdash;&mdash; config
    |   |   |&mdash;&mdash; models
    |   |   |&mdash;&mdash; routes
    |   |   |&mdash;&mdash; server.js
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; views
    |
    |&mdash;&mdash; tr-frontend
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; App.js
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; assets
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; components
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; docs
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; screenshots
    |   |&mdash;&mdash; tests
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    On the backend, "models" defines the database models, "routes" configures the server URLs and 
    their behavior, "views" contains all the Handlebars templates, and "server.js" is the entry point
    to the app. On the frontend, "components" contains all the React component files and "App.js" 
    sets up the app navigation and acts as its entry point as well. 
</p>

<h4>Data Structures</h4>
<p>
    Our database object schemas are all defined with Mongoose under "tr-backend/models". They are 
    fairly readable by themselves, but here are tabular representations for easier reference:

<h4>Design Rationale</h4>
<p>
    Ultimately, our design was centered around creating two applications that stay synchronized
    because they talk to the same backend. Our choice to design a REST API was mostly 
    based on simplicity and the nature of our other tools -- JSON is easy to understand and 
    convenient to work with in JavaScript, and React Native life cycle methods make it easy to 
    perform network requests that load in data as soon as certain screens render.
</p>
<p>
    In designing our database, we were left with the challenging task of creating generalized 
    schemas with only a few samples of the data that would actually go into it. Scalability was 
    a priority, but we knew that the maximum amount of data we ever need to support would be 
    relatively small: there are only <a href="https://www2.ncdhhs.gov/dhsr/EMS/trauma/traumarac.html">
    8 regional advisory committees</a>, 12 trauma centers, and 126 hospitals in North Carolina. 
    Therefore, we chose schemas that prioritized ease of implementation rather than optimizing 
    for minimal storage/query time. 
</p>
<p>
    Our code has very few dependencies aside from by Expo, Express, and Mongoose. We take this 
    as a sign that we chose good tools, as they've been mostly comprehensive enough to support
    all the functionality we need. Smaller libraries that play a role include 
    <a href="http://www.passportjs.org">Passport.js</a> for login authentication, 
    <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser">Body Parser</a>for reading JSON request bodies
    on the backend, and the <a href="https://reactnavigation.org"> React Navigation</a> community 
    library for setting up tab and stack-based navigation. All of our dependencies are also open
    source and popular solutions within the JavaScript community.
