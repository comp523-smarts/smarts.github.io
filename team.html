            <h4>Team Rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Behavior:</b> All team members should notify the others/client 
                    if they will be late or will miss a scheduled meeting. Team communications
                    will take place mainly on Slack, with discussions on scheduling, design, 
                    and development focused on appropriate channels. We will aim to meet weekly
                    to discuss the direction of development with the client, outline our development
                    targets for the next week, and pair program with each other. Our goal is to have 
                    every member understand each part of the code so everyone can collaborate and help 
                    with each other's problems. Lastly, all of our design decisions will be made with 
                    end-user in mind.

                    <b>Style:</b> We will be following the coding style guidelines provided 
                    by <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">Airbnb</a> for Javascript 
                    and React.
