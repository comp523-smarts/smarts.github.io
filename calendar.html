                <li><b>20 February</b> <span class="text-success">(client)</span>:
                    Attended a Mid-Carolina RAC team meeting and had an awesome opportunity to 
                    discuss our concept directly with end-users. Got a lot of positive feedback 
                    on our current specs, as well as proposals for features we hadn't even 
                    considered (e.g. voice interactivity). 
                </li>

                <li><b>15 February</b> <span class="text-info">(team)</span>:
                    Met to discuss our tech stack and produce an architecture diagram. 
                    Researched supporting libraries for local data storage on phones 
                    and screen navigation with React Native. Divided development roles 
                    up between team members with Ben and Clark on mobile frontend, 
                    Przemek on backend, and Andrew on admin web portal frontend. 
                </li>

                <li><b>5 February</b> <span class="text-info">(team)</span>:
                    Brainstormed rough designs for content screens that support core 
                    app functionality. Drew layout mockups that can be iterated on later 
                    to emphasize our UI/UX priorities. Returned to the App Lab to evaluate our 
                    backend tech options; decided on the combination of Node.js, Express, 
                    and MongoDB - all hosted on Heroku - to build out a set of REST endpoints. 
                </li>

                <li><b>1 February</b> <span class="text-success">(client)</span>:
                    Discussed a draft of our app specifications with a paramedic over video-chat 
                    to help us determine which features to prioritize. Also had a tour of the 
                    trauma department at UNC Hospitals. Finally, used the insights from our conversation 
                    to finalize our <a href="specifications.html">specs deliverable</a>.
                </li>

                <li><b>29 January</b> <span class="text-info">(team)</span>:
                    Met with mentor to discuss website and expectations of us as students in the class. 
                    Afterwards, we sat down as a team to produce a set of clarifying questions for our 
                    next client meeting. With the advisory of the app lab, we decided that React Native 
                    and Github will be our main development tools for this project. 
                </li>

                <li><b>25 January</b> <span class="text-success">(client)</span>:
                    Held first meeting with the client to begin discussion on app features. 
                    Regrouped as a team afterwards to combine notes, decide team roles, and create behavioral guidelines. 
                    Meeting notes <a href="notes/1-25-client-meeting.txt">here</a>.
