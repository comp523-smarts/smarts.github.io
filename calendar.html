                <li><b>5 February</b> <span class="text-info">(team)</span>:
                    Created UI layout mockups that support basic mobile app functionality. 
                    Discussed backend tech options with App Lab and decided to use Node.js 
                    for a backend REST API and Mongodb as the supporting database. 
                </li>

                <li><b>1 February</b> <span class="text-success">(client)</span>:
                    Discussed our specifications draft with a paramedic over video-chat
                    to confirm our design and feature ideas would be helpful in the field. Had a tour of the 
                    trauma department at UNC Hospitals. Used insights from conversation to finalize our
                    <a href="specifications.html">specs document</a>.

                <li><b>29 January</b> <span class="text-info">(team)</span>:
                    Initially met with mentor to discuss website and expectations 
                    of us as students in the class. Afterwards sat down to produce a set of questions
                    we wanted to ask at our next client meeting. Also decided, with the advisory of the 
                    App Lab, to use React Native and Github as our primary development tools. 
                </li>

                <li><b>25 January</b> <span class="text-success">(client)</span>:
                    Held first meeting with the client to begin discussion on app features. 
                    Regrouped as a team afterwards to combine notes, decide team roles, and create behavioral guidelines.
