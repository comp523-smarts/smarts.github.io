            <hr>
            <p>
                <em>Trauma Ready</em> is a mobile app that was created for the Trauma Department at 
                UNC Hospitals by a group of computer science students at UNC. It runs on both iPhone
                and Android, but is currently only available as an alpha version on the Google Play
                store (i.e. Android). Its purpose is to provide a pocket-reference for all the 
                information that you as a paramedic might need to route patients to different 
                hospitals.

                This includes a list of phone numbers, addresses, emails, and services for all 
                hospitals participating in our database. In addition, there are digital 
                representations
