                Our project serves the first-responders of health care systems throughout North Carolina by making their transport decisions easier and faster. The goal is to create a product that is reliable, cohesive, and natural for EMTs to use so that they can get patients to trauma centers in less time. Time is a critical factor in these situations, and we believe that helping paramedics do their job will translate to helping patients receive more timely care. As a team, we value servicing the healthcare professionals who continuously service the world with their work.
