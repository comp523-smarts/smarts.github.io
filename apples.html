                Our project serves the first-responders of health care systems throughout North Carolina by making their transport decisions easier and faster. The goal is to create a product that is reliable, cohesive, and natural for paramedics, EMTs, and other trauma employees to use, so that they can get patients to trauma centers in less time. Time is a critical factor in these situations, and we believe that helping paramedics do their job will translate to helping patients receive more timely care. As a team, we value servicing the healthcare professionals who continuously service the world with their work.

                First-responders work tirelessly to save the lives of trauma victims, and in their line of work every second counts. By creating a mobile application that acts as a reference for the navigation of the different trauma activation criteria in North Carolinaâ€™s 12 RACs (Regional Advisory Committees) and of the services available at the numerous hospitals found in these RACs, we prevent the wasting of time and building of stress that occur through shuffling through the various trauma activation cards first-responders must currently use. Each of these RACs has trauma criteria that is similar but slightly different from one another, which can create complications when transporting a trauma victim to a trauma center/hospital in a different RAC than the first-responder regularly operates in. This time saved can be now put towards further stabilization of the trauma victim, and the application may also provide for a smoother transition to the trauma center/hospital to which the patient is being transported.
