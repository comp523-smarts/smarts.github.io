                Paramedics currently use a system of physical notecards to decide 
                where to transport a trauma patient and at which activation level. 
                Unfortunately, the criteria for transport is confusing and non-standardized 
                at different hospitals around North Carolina. This forces EMTs to read through 
                a series of checklists and facilities while in high-pressure, time-sensitive 
                environments.

                <em>Trauma Ready</em> is a mobile app that will provide a reference for these teams 
                in the field so they have easier access to information and can make fast, correct 
                routing decisions. It is designed to be simple, intuitive, and accessible in all 
                environments - particularly the dim lighting in the back of an ambulance or helicopter. 
                To maximize engagement, it will be freely available on both iPhone and Android. 
                Lastly, the information provided by the app will be easily updatable through 
                an administrator web portal as activation criterias change over time.
