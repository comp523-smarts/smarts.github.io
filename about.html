                Paramedics currently use a system of physical notecards to decide 
                where to transport a trauma patient and at which activation level. 
                Unfortunately, the criteria for transport is confusing and non-standardized 
                at different hospitals around North Carolina. This forces EMTs to read through 
                a series of checklists and facilities while in a high-pressure, time-sensitive 
                environment.

                Our application will provide a reference for these teams in the field so they 
                have easier access to information and can make fast, correct routing decisions. 
                Its design focus is to be simple, intuitive, and accessible in all environments 
                - particularly the dim lighting in the back of an ambulance or helicopter. To 
                maximize engagement, we will be developing cross platform with 
                <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. Lastly, as 
                activation criterias change the information provided by the app will be easily 
                updatable through an administrator web portal.

                Throughout the semester this page will be updated with pictures, demos, and 
                feature descriptions as our development progresses.
