            <ul>
                <li>As a User:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want a mobile app so that I can access the information I need on-the-go</li>
                        <li>I want a display that is visible in low-lighting so I can see the information in dark environments</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to access activation cards for different trauma centers so that I can accurately route patients</li>
                        <li>I want quick information on a partiular trauma center so that I don't have to waste important time searching</li>
                        <li>I want a simple, intuitive application so that I can get started without "learning" the application</li>
                        <li>I potentially want trauma center recommendations based on GPS so that I can find the nearest locations without manually searching</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As an Admin:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want to update content on the app without knowing how to code so I can present paramedics with the most relevant information</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Definite:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application must provide accurate information on activation code criteria for all trauma centers it records</li>
                        <li>Application must provide accurate information on the services available at different trauma centers</li>
                        <li>Application must provide contact information for each trauma center</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Perhaps:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application may provide information on destination protocols to trauma employees navigate their transport</li>
                        <li>Application may show closest trauma centers to the user's location via GPS assuming internet connection is available</li>
                        <li>Users may search directly for best-fit activation cards by injury descriptions or trauma center name</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Improbable:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application will notify a selected trauma center automatically of an incoming patient's activation code and the medical justification for that activation code</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
