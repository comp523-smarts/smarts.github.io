<h2>User Stories</h2>
<br>
<h4>As a User:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        I want a cross-platform mobile app so that I can access the information I need on-the-go and 
        from any device
    </li>
    <li>
        I want a high-contrast display that is visible in low-lighting so that I can read the 
        information in dark environments
    </li>
    <li>
        I want to access activation cards for different trauma centers with as few clicks as possible 
        so that I can quickly get the information I need
    </li>
    <li>
        I want a simple user interface so that I can get to my information without the app design 
        getting in the way
    </li>        
    <li>
        I want an app that contains activation, service, and contact information for each hospital 
        in one place so I don't have to look it up multiple times
    </li>
    <li>
        I want an app that continues to work without internet so that it's reliable and useful in 
        areas with poor connectivity
    </li> 
    <li>
        I potentially want an app that assists me in making my routing decisions by providing 
        recommendations based on GPS
    </li>
    <li>
        I potentially want to view activation criteria as listed on the app so that I can get the 
        information online as well as on mobile
    </li>
    <li>
        I potentially want to search for activation cards by trauma criteria so that I can find 
        relevant trauma centers without having to guess and check
    </li>
    <li>
        I potentially want an app that provides information on routing and traffic so that I can 
        get directions more efficiently
    </li>
    <li>
        I potentially want a mobile app that notifies the selected trauma center of the activation 
        code and related information so that the patient can relieve faster treatment upon arriving
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>As an Admin:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        I want to update activation criteria on the app without having a technical background so 
        that I can present paramedics with the latest information
    </li>
    <li>
        I want the mobile app to refresh quickly when I make administrator updates so all paramedics
        are immediately receiving the same information
    </li>
    <li>
        I want to use a login-based web portal to update my criteria so I can input information 
        easily via keyboard
    </li>
    <li>
        I potentially want a quick tutorial on how to use the web portal so I understand how my 
        actions affect the app better
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h4>Functional</h4> <!-- I/O pairings, i.e. "this behavior produces that result"-->
<ul>
    <li><b>Definite:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application must provide accurate information on activation code criteria for all 
                trauma centers it records
            </li>
            <li>
                Application must provide accurate information on the services available at 
                different trauma centers
            </li>
            <li>
                Application must provide contact information for each trauma center
            </li>
            <li>
                Application must show closest trauma centers to the user's location, and distance 
                to those trauma centers, via GPS, assuming internet connection is available
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Perhaps:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application may provide information on how to best transport the patient to the selected 
                trauma center
            </li>
            <li>
                Application may allow users to login/enter a specific code, provided by an 
                Administrator (the user's employer) to gain access to the trauma information of a specific 
                set of regional trauma centers
            </li>
            <li>
                Application may allow administrators to select which regional trauma centers they wish 
                for trauma employees (users) to be allowed access to information on
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Improbable:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application will notify a selected trauma center automatically of an incoming 
                patient's activation code and the medical justification for that activation code
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Usability</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Perhaps:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application may provide a tutorial for new users on how to operate the application
            </li>
            <li>
                Web portal may provide a tutorial/documentation for administrators on how to update 
                information in the application
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Reliability</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Definite:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application must provide some sort of color coding to match with trauma activation 
                code criteria
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li>
        <b>Perhaps:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application may continue to function on a basic level (essentially, all "Definite 
                Requirements" still function) without an internet connection
            </li>
            <li>
                Application should be readable under extreme lighting conditions (contain a daytime 
                and nighttime setting)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Performance</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Perhaps:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Application must respond to a search query (such as the name of a certain regional 
            trauma center) fairly quickly
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Supportability</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Definite:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Application must provide a web portal for administrators to be able to login and 
            update information within the application, without needing any programming knowledge
        </li>
        <li>
            Application may update every time an Administrator changes information within the 
            application, in order to keep information up-to-date
        </li>
        <li>
            Application may provide the foundation to add further hospital activation criteria, 
            such as stroke or cardiac activation criteria
        </li>
        <li>
            Application may provide the foundation add more regional trauma centers, and their 
            related information, in North Carolina
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
    <li>

            <li>Application must function on iOS and Android</li>
            <li>Application must provide an intuitive layout for users</li>
            <li>
                Application connects with a database that stores the information presented on the 
                application, and can be updated through the web portal by an administrator
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Improbable:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Application may come in the form of a web/desktop application that can be used by 
            Emergency Department employees on a desktop computer
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
