                <li>As a User:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want a mobile app so that I can access the information I need on-the-go</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that functions on Android and iOS so that I can access the information on either mobile OS</li>
                        <li>I want a display that is visible in low-lighting so I can see the information in dark environments</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to access activation cards for different trauma centers so that I can accurately route patients</li>
                        <li>I want quick information on a particular trauma center so that I don't have to waste important time searching</li>
                        <li>I want a simple, intuitive application so that I can get started without "learning" the application</li>
                        <li>I potentially want trauma center recommendations based on GPS so that I can find the nearest locations without manually searching</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that provides me information on the services provided by regional trauma centers so that I can more accurately route patients</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that provides me contact information to regional trauma centers so that I can contact them easily</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that stores the most important information (trauma activation cards, services, contact information) on the phone, so that my application still works without an internet connection</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that still works without an internet connection so that I can use it in areas where there is no internet connection</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that provides color coding based on the trauma activation codes so that I can more easily determine the correct trauma activation code for a patient</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that provides information on destination protocols so that I can more accurately route patients</li>

                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that provides information on how to best transport patients to trauma center so that I can more effectively route patients</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that allows me to use search criteria to limit the trauma centers displayed on the application so that I can more effectively find a trauma center and the proper activation codes for that center</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that provides a tutorial so that I can quickly learn how to operate the application</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that responds to a search query within a reasonable amount of time so that I am not losing time in vital predicaments</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that notifies the selected trauma center of the activation code, and related information, so that the patient can be more easily transferred to the trauma center</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>I want to be able to login to a web portal so that only I can update content on the app</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to use a web portal to update content on the app so that it is easier to update information (typing on the computer vs typing on the phone)</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that provides the foundation to add more activation criteria, such as for strokes, so that I can expand the usage of the application</li>
                        <li>I want a mobile app that updates every time I make an update to the content so that users always have up-to-date information</li>
                        <li>I would like some form of generic account for each agency so that I can select which trauma centers users (the employees) have access to information on</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a web portal that provides a tutorial/documentation so that I can quickly learn how to update information on the application</li>
                        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that provides the foundation to include more regional trauma centers, and their related information, in North Carolina so that I can expand the usage of the app</li>
                        <li>I potentially want an application that works on desktop/web so that emergency department employees can use the application on their computers</li>
