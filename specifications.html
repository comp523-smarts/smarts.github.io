          <b>Tweet</b>: A cross-platform mobile app which helps paramedics navigate the trauma

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <hr>
      <b>As a User:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>I want a cross-platform mobile app so that I can access the information I need on-the-go and from any device</li>
        <li>I want a high-contrast display that is visible in low-lighting so that I can read the information in dark environments</li>
        <li>I want to access activation cards for different trauma centers with as few clicks as possible so that I can quickly get the information I need</li>
        <li>I want a simple user interface so that I can get to my information without the app design getting in the way</li>        
        <li>I want an app that contains activation, service, and contact information for each hospital in one place so I don't have to look it up multiple times</li>
        <li>I want an app that continues to work without internet so that it's reliable and useful in areas with poor connectivity</li> 
        <li>I potentially want an app that assists me in making my routing decisions by providing recommendations based on GPS</li>
        <li>I potentially want to view activation criteria as listed on the app so that I can get the information online as well as on mobile</li>
        <li>I potentially want to search for activation cards by trauma criteria so that I can find relevant trauma centers without having to guess and check</li>
        <li>I potentially want an app that provides information on routing and traffic so that I can get directions more efficiently</li>
        <li>I potentially want a mobile app that notifies the selected trauma center of the activation code and related information so that the patient can relieve faster treatment upon arriving</li>
      </ul>

      <b>As an Admin:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>I want to update activation criteria on the app without having a technical background so that I can present paramedics with the latest information</li>
        <li>I want the mobile app to refresh quickly when I make administrator updates so all paramedics are immediately receiving the same information</li>
        <li>I want to use a login-based web portal to update my criteria so I can input information easily via keyboard</li>
        <li>I potentially want a quick tutorial on how to use the web portal so I understand how my actions affect the app better</li>
      </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Application must provide information on destination protocols to trauma employees to help determine
                where to transport trauma patients</li>
              <li>Application must show closest trauma centers to the user's location, and distance to those trauma
                centers, via GPS, assuming internet connection is available</li>
              <li>Application must match trauma experienced by patient with the services available at regional trauma
                centers to assist the user in deciding where to send the patient</li>
              <li>Application must allow users to search directly for best-fit activation cards by injury descriptions
                or trauma center name</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Perhaps:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Application may provide information on how to best transport the patient to the selected trauma center</li>
            <li>Application may allow users to login/enter a specific code, provided by an Administrator(the user's
              employer) to gain access to the trauma information of a specific set of regional trauma centers</li>
            <li>Application may allow administrators to select which regional trauma centers they wish for trauma
              employees (users) to be allowed access to information on </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Improbable:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Application will notify a selected trauma center automatically of an incoming patient's activation code
              and the medical justification for that activation code</li>

              to keep information up-to-date</li>

              cardiac activation criteria</li>
            <li>Application may provide the foundation add more regional trauma centers, and their related information,
              in North Carolina</li>
