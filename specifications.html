                <li>As a User:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want a mobile app so that I can access the information I need on-the-go</li>
                        <li>I want a display that is visible in low-lighting so I can see the information in dark environments</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to access activation cards for different trauma centers so that I can accurately route patients</li>
                        <li>I want quick information on a partiular trauma center so that I don't have to waste important time searching</li>
                        <li>I want a simple, intuitive application so that I can get started without "learning" the application</li>
                        <li>I potentially want trauma center recommendations based on GPS so that I can find the nearest locations without manually searching</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As an Admin:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want to update content on the app without knowing how to code so I can present paramedics with the most relevant information</li>
