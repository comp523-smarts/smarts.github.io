            As of right now, the app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. Because the application is under
                Alpha/Internal Testing, the only way to download the application currently is request the manager of
                the Google Play Developer Account to add you to the list of Testers for the Application, and then send
                you the Opt-in URL in order to download the application from the Google Play Store. The Client has been
                provided instructions on how to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application may also be downloaded using Expo. To do this, the user must download the Expo app
                from the Google Play store, and then go to <a href="https://exp.host/@trauma-statt/trauma-ready">this link</a>
                and scan the QR code to run the application through Expo.
