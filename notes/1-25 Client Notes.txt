Team Introductions
- Al, Julie, and Brian 

3 different EMS agencies, 300 different employees, different agencies transport differently
Trying to keep up with all trauma activations is problematic; multiple types of activations 

Function: 
- EMS picks someone up, operates off destination protocols to figure out where to transport patients for appropriate care
- Severe injuries are time sensitive - paramedic need to stabilize patient and determine how to best transport them 
	(drive vs airfare, route to close regional hospital vs far large hospital, how to choose different activation levels) 
- Full-tier (red) vs partial-tier (yellow) activations alert different levels of staff to handle trauma 
	- Different hospitals use different terminology (red/yellow, first/second, alpha/bravo)
	- Different hospitals use different criteria to evaluate
- Paramedics have to shuffle through cards to make decisions; cards fit in a back pocket 

Goal: 
- Place to keep all information available on demand and accessible in a logical way 
- Paramedics can use a device (e.g. mobile phone, easily usable in field) and ED’s can use a computer

Design: 
- Color coding ideal, but everyone’s different
- Quick reference 
- Easily updated by non-technical administrators as trauma activations and criteria change 
- GPS(?) questionable, might be complex and cannot afford unreliability but otherwise helpful - changes with air transport
- Basic information about services offered at different trauma centers
- Summoning air transport(?)
- Android and Apple (50:50), night and day options, high contrast and easy to see is essential
- No need for decision aid; just easy information access

- Easy information access and organization — essential
- Easily updatable information for administrators — essential
- Recommendation engine based on trauma descriptions(?) — nice-to-haves

- Reference cards as checklists
- Decisions for which hospital and which activation level 
- Making decisions explicitly communicated 

Priorities: 
- End-user focus
