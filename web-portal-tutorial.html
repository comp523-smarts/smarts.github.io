            There are four main pages on the web portal: hospitals, RACs, activation codes, and traumas.   Every hospital, RAC, code, etc. also includes a 'notes' field.
            <br>
            </p>


            <p>
            <b>Hospitals</b>: stores the list of hospitals found in the app directory, as well as their contact
            information, trauma level, and offered services.<br>
            <b>RACs</b>: stores the list of regional advisory committees that determine various trauma levels at
            each hospital. Each hospital has an RAC.<br>
            <b>Activation codes</b>: These are the various levels (adult red, pediatric yellow, etc.) used to
            classify traumas according to different RACs. Each activation code includes a bulleted list
            of traumas.<br>
            <b>Traumas</b>: These are the individual traumas that can be found under various activation codes.
            Each trauma has a field that shows which activation codes include it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            The button that looks like a pencil and paper will allow you to edit an entry. Make the changes in the
            field you want to edit, then either click the floppy disk to save your changes or the warning symbol to
            discard them. The trash can will delete an entry from the table - make sure to press OK on the alert.<br><br>

            By clicking on the 'register another administrator' button at the bottom of the page,
            you will be able to give someone else access to the web portal, allowing them to
            make changes to the data.
